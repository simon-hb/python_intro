    "A `parameter` refers to a variable that can be found within our function definition code. Parameters gives us the ability to pass information into a function where it is essential to produce a particular result. Think of a parameter as a placeholder, it contains no actual value. Once a parameter contains a value, it is known as an `argument`. The term parameter and argument is sometimes used interchangeably but is useful to know that a parameter only becomes an argument once a value is passed to the function.\n",

    "### The return Statement\n",
    "The caller passes information to a function via parameters / arguments in order to run some computation on those values. Once that computation is complete, the function should pass information back to the caller. The `return` statement is used to pass information \"out\" of a function or back to the caller. To capture that returned value, a function invocation is assigned to a variable. If the `return` statement is **not** used, the function will return a default value of `None`. To correctly return a value from a function, the value must be on the same line, directly after the return statement."
